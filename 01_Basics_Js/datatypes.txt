Data types in Javascript :

primitive data types: number(numerical value), string, boolean(true false), undefined(kuch define hi nhi kiya hai), null(type of karenge toh object show hoga)
, BigInt, Symbol. 



Non-primitive datatype:

objects(Array and functions) :- it is a collection of value


operator 

Arithmatic : + , -,*,/ , modulas, exponetion, increment decrement 

assignment : =,  += , -=,*=,/= assigning value form right to left

Comparison Operators :

1 equal to (==): string converted into a number that why give true as an output don't check the datatype 

2 equal to and type( === )  (strict version): here it checks data types and doesn't convert string into numbers that's why gives false as output

3 not equal to (!=) : same as ==  cpmparse with number only 

4 not equal to and types (!==): check it striclty

5 <,> <=, >= 

Logical operator : 

logical &&
logical ||
logical !
